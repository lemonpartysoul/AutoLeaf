Below you will find the steps required in order to run our semantic web application Autoleaf. 

1: Open GraphDB workbench and create a new repository with the OWL-Max ruleset (can be either optimized or not, it does not matter).

2: Upload and import the file titled Ontology_v12_RDF.owl into your repository.

3: Copy the repository URL. In line 9 of main.js, paste it as the value for the variable "graphDBSparqlEndpoint".

4: You may now open index.html and run the application.
